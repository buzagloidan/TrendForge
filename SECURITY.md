## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The TrendForge team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 📧 Private Disclosure
Please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to the maintainers via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 🕐 Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix & Release**: Depends on severity (1-4 weeks)

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Environment**: Use `.env` files and keep them private
- **Updates**: Always use the latest version
- **Network**: Run in secure network environments

### For Contributors
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Testing**: Test security-related changes thoroughly
- **Documentation**: Document security implications

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- **Risk**: Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized usage
- **Mitigation**: Use environment variables, never hardcode keys
- **Detection**: Monitor API usage for anomalies

### Rate Limiting
- **Risk**: Excessive API calls can result in service suspension
- **Mitigation**: Built-in delays and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage patterns

### Content Generation
- **Risk**: Generated content may include sensitive information
- **Mitigation**: Review generated content before publishing
- **Filtering**: Implement content filtering where appropriate
